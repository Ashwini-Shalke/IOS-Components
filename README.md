### Swift Components :- 
This document will brief about most of the major componets. Its just a simple reference document for a easy and quick revision 
for the beginnner like me who wants to learn Swift from scratch to make a difference in the mobile development world. 
Used both story board and programmatical ways to acheived the functionality of the components.


#### Before you begin must known :-
1. What swift is.
2. Basic functionality of swift.
3. How to create a new Xcode Project.



### List of Components :- 
* View Controller(link)
* Navigation Controller(link)
* All about navigation element(link)


### Brief about components:- 

* View Controller : - A view controller manages a single root view, which may itself contain any number of subviews. 
User interactions with that view hierarchy are handled by your view controller, which coordinates with 
other objects of your app as needed. Every app has at least one view controller whose content fills the main window.
If your app has more content than can fit onscreen at once, use multiple view controllers to manage different 
parts of that content.

In this project two View Contollers has been used to define the transition between them,using Seague by using Story board and seague.

  * what is seague :- A segue defines a transition between two view controllers in your app's storyboard file. 
The starting point of a segue is the button, table row, or gesture recognizer that initiates the segue. 
The end point of a segue is the view controller you want to display.

  * Autolayout :- auto layout is a constraint-based layout system. It allows developers to create an adaptive UI that 
responds appropriately to changes in screen size and device orientation.
